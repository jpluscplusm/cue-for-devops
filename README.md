Wikipedia defines a readme as a file that contains information about other files
in a directory or archive...

As per formatting... stick to the Unix traditions as much as possible, and/or
use markdown especially for github projects, which renders README.md as html.

    - ASCII characters only, if the README is written in English

    - write it in English if possible, and ship translated version
      with two-letter language code extension like README.ja

    - 80 characters or less per line

    - single empty line between paragraphs

    - dashes under the headers

    - indent using whitespace

    - (0x20) not tab

Packer
------

With Packer we create our AMI.

Supposing we have some data to bind at the time of creation...

So, we have a `prod` and `qa` AMIs.
These call Ansible playbooks with appropriate values.
